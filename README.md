Prompt

"let's consider a long, quiet country road with houses scattered very sparsely along it. (We can picture the road as a long line segment, with an eastern endpoint and a western endpoint.) Further, let's suppose that despite the bucolic setting, the residents of allthese houses arre avid cell phone users. You want to place cell phone base stations at certain points along the road, so that every house is within four miles of one of the base stations. Give an efficent algorithm that achieves this goal, using as few base stations as possible."
